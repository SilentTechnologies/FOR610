Using debugger for more controlled approach
	disable dynamic base (ASLR)
	load the packed specimen in debugger
	locate the end of the unpacker - set breakpoint
		can be time consuming and challenging
	run specimen so it unpacks original program and pause
	single-step to let process jump to unpacked code (OEP - Original Entry Point)
	Dump unpacked process
	fix the PE header - pay attention to IAT and EP

if the program is unpacked - should be able to search for current region/string reference - should be lots of strings now
