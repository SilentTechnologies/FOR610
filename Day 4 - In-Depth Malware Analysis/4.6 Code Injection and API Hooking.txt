API calls regularly used for code injection
	CreateToolhelp32Snapshot - gets a list of running process
		NtQuerySystemInformation
	EnumProceses - Gets a list of running processes 
		NtQuerySystemInformation
	OpenProcess - Opens a handle to the target Process
		NtOpenProcess/ZwOpenProcess
	VirtualAllocEx - Allocates memory space in the target process
		NtAllocateVirtualMemory/ZwAllocateVirtualMemory
	WriteProcessMemory - Write specified contents into memory of the target process
		NtWriteVirtualMemory/ZwWriteVirtualMemory
	CreateRemoteThread - Runs code in a new thread of the process
		NtCreateThreatEx/ZwCreateThreadEx

	Native API calls are usually prefixed with Nt, Zw, and Rtl

	IDA - g = jump to address

inline-hooks
	ReadProcessMemory - Read first few bytes from target function for backup
	VirtualProtect - modify permissions on target memory region to writeable 
	WriteProcess Memory - overwrite start of targeted function with opcodes for a jump into the rootkit

Normal 
JMP = 0xE9
PUSH = 0x68
RET = 0xC3

easy way to perform a jump
PUSH (0x68) folowed by a RET(0xC3)
