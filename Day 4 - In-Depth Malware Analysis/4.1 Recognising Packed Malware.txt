different types of packers
	sections - executable file - loaded into memory
	entry point - address of first instruction in the program - AddressOfEntryPoint 
	import address table (IAT) - pointers to functions in external DLLs (API calls)

So many different types of packers
UPX - one of the few packers which can unpack
	upx -d(decrypt)

step 1 - is the program packed - if so what with
	PEStudio - sections/entry-point
	strings 
distribution of byte values 
	not packed - less uniform distribution
	packed - uniform distribution of byte value

bytehist
	load windows.exe and generate histogram of byte distrobutions

Measure entropy
	pescanner.py <file> 
		entropy values for every section in file
	diec <file>
		try to determine packer
	exeinfo pe
		try to determine packer
