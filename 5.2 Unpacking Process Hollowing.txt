	CreateProcessA
		can start process in a suspended state
	VirtualAllocEx
		remember 40h gives read/write + execute
	WriteProcessMemory

CreateProcess
	launched suspended child process
NtUnmapViewOfSection
	deallocates virtual memory of the process
VirtualAllocEx
	Allocate memory space in the child process to make room for injection
WriteProcessMemory
	writes new code into allocated memory
ResumeThreat
	awakens the child process to run injected code

if code hollowing is being used
	SetBPX WriteProcessMemory - then Dump memory contents

static analysis is easiest in IDA
	IDA - g = go to memory location
Dynamic analysis easier in x64/x32dbg
